# Python Tasks

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate basic mathematical operations and function implementations.

---

## **Task 1: Factorial Calculation**

### **Description**
The script `Task 1.py` defines a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

### **Features**
- Accepts an integer as input from the user.
- Computes the factorial using an iterative approach.
- Handles edge cases:
  - Negative numbers: Displays a message that factorial is not defined.
  - `0` or `1`: Returns `1`.

### **Usage**
```bash
python Task\ 1.py
````

**Example:**

```
Enter a number: 5
Factorial of 5 is 120
```

---

## **Task 2: Mathematical Calculations**

### **Description**

The script `Task 2.py` performs basic mathematical calculations using Python's `math` module.

### **Operations**

* Square root
* Natural logarithm (log base e)
* Sine (in radians)

### **Usage**

```bash
python Task\ 2.py
```

**Example:**

```
Enter a number: 4
Square root: 2.0
Natural logarithm: 1.3862943611198906
Sine: -0.7568024953079282
```

### **Notes**

* The input must be a positive number because:

  * Square root and logarithm of negative numbers are not defined in real numbers.
* The sine function expects the input in radians.

## **Requirements**

* Python 3.x

Do you want me to **add installation instructions**, **usage screenshots**, and **expected output examples with images** to make it more professional? Or keep it simple?
